"""
Critic — System 2 (Slow Thinking) for THE SCIENTIST.

Implements Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory:
  System 1 (Thinker/Dreamer) generates ideas quickly and intuitively.
  System 2 (Critic) monitors, challenges, and gates those ideas before
  they enter the knowledge graph.

The Critic does NOT generate ideas. It receives candidate thoughts from
System 1 and runs an adversarial multi-turn dialogue to determine whether
they survive scrutiny.

Four possible verdicts:
  ACCEPT  — Passes quality bar. Added to graph with calibrated confidence.
  REFINE  — Kernel of truth but weak formulation. System 1 gets another pass.
  REJECT  — Incoherent, hallucinated, or trivially obvious. Discarded.
  DEFER   — Not enough evidence to decide. Sent to InsightBuffer for incubation.

The "laziness principle": System 2 only activates for high-stakes claims.
Routine concept extraction and weak associative edges bypass the Critic entirely.

Usage:
    critic = Critic(brain, embedding_index=emb_index, insight_buffer=buf)
    verdict_log = critic.evaluate(candidate)
    if verdict_log.verdict == Verdict.ACCEPT:
        # add to graph with verdict_log.confidence

- ACCEPT: The claim survived scrutiny. The defense addressed challenges adequately.
  The insight is genuinely novel, precisely stated, still contains explicit correspondences, and does not retreat into generic pattern language.
- REFINE: There is a kernel of truth, but the formulation needs work.
  The claim should be reformulated with System 2's feedback incorporated. Use REFINE when the thesis may be salvageable but the current wording lacks explicit mapping, becomes too generic, or overstates the evidence.
- REJECT: The claim is incoherent, based on surface-level pattern matching,
  is merely restating known knowledge, or the defense failed to address
  the core challenge. Log the reason for rejection.
- DEFER: Not enough evidence to decide. The claim might be right but we
  cannot verify it now. Save for later re-evaluation as more knowledge arrives.

Confidence rubric (if ACCEPT):
- 0.50-0.65: Provisionally accepted — plausible but needs further evidence.
