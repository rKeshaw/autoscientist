"""
Thinker — Deliberate, goal-directed reasoning for THE SCIENTIST.

Unlike the Dreamer (random walks, serendipity), the Thinker does structured,
convergent reasoning — working toward *answers*, not just associations.

Thinking patterns:
  1. Dialectical   — evidence for/against, then synthesis
  2. Analogical    — transfer solution from analogous domain
  3. Reductive     — break question into simpler sub-questions
  4. Experimental  — thought experiments: "If X, then we'd expect Y"
  5. Integrative   — combine ideas into a unifying principle

Usage:
    thinker = Thinker(brain, observer, embedding_index)
    log = thinker.think()              # auto-picks best question
    log = thinker.think(question="...") # think about specific topic

DIALECTICAL_PROMPT = """You are a scientist reasoning carefully about a question.

QUESTION: {question}

RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE:
{context}

Think dialectically:
1. What evidence or reasoning SUPPORTS a positive answer?
2. What evidence or reasoning ARGUES AGAINST it?
3. Given both sides, what is the most defensible conclusion right now?
4. What SPECIFIC piece of evidence or experiment would resolve the tension?

Write your reasoning as a structured argument (2-4 paragraphs).
Be precise. Cite specific ideas from the knowledge provided.
"""

ANALOGICAL_PROMPT = """You are a scientist looking for analogies that could solve a problem.

QUESTION: {question}

KNOWLEDGE FROM VARIOUS DOMAINS:
{context}

Is there a problem in a DIFFERENT domain that has a similar structure to this one?
If so:
1. What is the analogous problem?
2. How was it solved there?
3. Can that solution transfer to our domain? What would need to change?
4. What does this analogy reveal that direct reasoning might miss?

If no useful analogy exists, say so honestly and explain what makes this problem unique.
"""

REDUCTIVE_PROMPT = """You are a scientist trying to break down a hard question.

QUESTION: {question}

RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE:
{context}

This question may be too complex to answer directly. Break it down:
1. What are the 2-4 simpler SUB-QUESTIONS that, if answered, would answer the main question?
2. For each sub-question, do we already have evidence in our knowledge?
3. Which sub-question is the MOST tractable right now?
4. Which sub-question, if answered, would have the HIGHEST leverage?

Respond with a JSON object:
{{

      "question": "the sub-question",
      "existing_evidence": "what we already know, or 'none'",

EXPERIMENTAL_PROMPT = """You are a scientist designing a thought experiment.

QUESTION: {question}

RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE:
{context}

Design a thought experiment to test this:
1. What HYPOTHESIS does this question imply?
2. IF the hypothesis is true, what SPECIFIC OBSERVABLE consequence would we expect?
3. IF the hypothesis is false, what would we expect instead?
4. Can we check either prediction against what we already know?
5. What is the verdict so far?

Write your thought experiment as a clear, step-by-step argument.
"""

These ideas all seem related but no one has articulated WHY:
{context}

QUESTION: {question}

Can you find a UNIFYING PRINCIPLE that:
1. Explains why all these ideas are connected?
2. Predicts something NEW that none of them state individually?
3. Is FALSIFIABLE — what would prove it wrong?

If you find one, state it precisely. If not, explain what's missing.
"""

PICK_PATTERN_PROMPT = """You are selecting a reasoning strategy for a scientific question.

QUESTION: {question}

Available strategies:
- dialectical: weigh evidence for and against (best for contested claims)
- analogical: find parallels in other domains (best for novel problems)
- reductive: break into sub-questions (best for complex, multi-part problems)
- experimental: design thought experiments (best for testable hypotheses)
- integrative: find unifying principles (best when many related facts exist)
