NODE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are building a knowledge graph for a scientific mind.

Read the following text carefully. Extract every distinct conceptual idea present.

Rules:
- Each node must be a self-contained conceptual statement — rich enough to stand alone
- Write each as 1-3 sentences. Not a keyword. Not a title. A thought.
- Capture the perspective, not just the topic
- If an idea contains a tension or uncertainty, include that in the statement
- Aim for 3 to 8 nodes per passage. Quality over quantity.

Example of a GOOD node:
  "REM sleep appears to loosen associative constraints, allowing ideas that
   were previously unrelated to form novel connections — this may explain why
   insights often occur upon waking."

Example of a BAD node (too vague/keyword-like):
  "REM sleep and creativity" ← this is a topic label, not a conceptual statement.

HYPOTHESIS_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are analyzing text for scientific hypotheses.

A hypothesis is a directional claim that:
- Makes a specific prediction about how things work
- Could in principle be tested or researched
- Goes beyond just describing — it proposes a mechanism or relationship

Read the following text and extract any hypotheses present.
For each hypothesis, provide:
- statement: the hypothesis as a clear claim
- predicted_answer: what it predicts will be found or confirmed
- testable_by: how it could be investigated

Respond ONLY with a JSON array of objects. If no hypotheses are present, return [].
No preamble. No markdown.

Example:
[
  {{
    "statement": "REM sleep enables insight by loosening associative constraints",
    "predicted_answer": "People woken from REM sleep will show higher remote associate scores",
    "testable_by": "Sleep lab studies measuring creativity after REM vs NREM awakenings"

EDGE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are mapping relationships between ideas in a knowledge graph.

Given these two ideas, determine if they have a meaningful relationship.

Idea A: {node_a}
Idea B: {node_b}

If they are related, respond with a JSON object:
{{
  "related": true,
  "type": one of ["supports", "causes", "contradicts", "analogy", "associated"],
  "analogy_depth": if type is "analogy", one of ["surface", "structural", "isomorphism"] — else omit,
  "narration": "one or two sentences explaining exactly how and why these ideas connect",
  "weight": a float (see rubric below),
  "confidence": a float (see rubric below)
}}

TYPE SELECTION RULES — read carefully before choosing:

Use "causes" when A is a mechanism, process, or event that directly produces B
as a physical or temporal effect. The test: does A happen BEFORE B and make B
happen? Examples:
  ✓ "High temperature increases molecular kinetic energy" → causes "increased pressure"
  ✓ "Mutations in replication introduce variation" → causes "heritable diversity"
  ✗ "Studies show X correlates with Y" → this is "supports", not "causes"

Use "supports" when A is evidence, reasoning, prior work, or context that makes
B more credible or likely — but A does not directly produce B.
  ✓ "Fossil record shows gradual change" → supports "evolution by natural selection"
  ✓ "Backpropagation computes gradients" → supports "gradient descent can train deep nets"

Use "contradicts" only when A and B make MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE claims — if A is
true, B must be false. Do NOT use for statements that merely contrast or
emphasize different aspects of the same phenomenon.
  ✓ "All objects fall at the same rate" contradicts "heavier objects fall faster"
  ✗ "Neural nets need data" vs "neural nets can overfit" — these are compatible

Use "analogy" when the same relational pattern appears in two different domains.
Specify depth:
  surface     — shared vocabulary or theme only
  structural  — same A:B::X:Y relational pattern across domains
  isomorphism — formally identical mathematical or logical structure

Use "associated" when the ideas co-occur or share a domain but have no direct
logical, causal, or analogical link. This is the CORRECT and FREQUENT answer
for ideas from the same domain that simply appear together. Do NOT force a
stronger type just because the ideas are related — topical proximity alone
means "associated".
  ✓ "Game theory developed in 1940s" associated with "Nash equilibrium defined later"
  ✓ "DNA has four bases" associated with "proteins have 20 amino acids"

Weight rubric (how STRONG is the relationship?):
- 0.1-0.3: Tangentially related, same broad topic but no direct logical link
- 0.4-0.6: Meaningfully connected, one informs understanding of the other
- 0.7-0.9: Strongly linked, one directly supports/contradicts/implies the other
- 1.0: Definitionally equivalent or logically entailed — VERY rare

Confidence rubric (how CERTAIN are you this relationship exists?):
- 0.1-0.3: Speculative — you think there might be a connection but it's not clear
- 0.4-0.6: Reasonable — the connection is plausible and you can articulate why
- 0.7-0.9: Strong — the connection is clearly supported by the content
- 1.0: Definitive — the text explicitly states this relationship

Analogy depth guide:
- surface: shared vocabulary, metaphor, or theme only. Example: "both involve networks"
- structural: same relational pattern between different entities. Example: "A relates to B the same way X relates to Y"
- isomorphism: formal mathematical or logical equivalence. Example: "the equations governing X are identical in form to those governing Y"

IMPORTANT: Do NOT mark ideas as related just because they share a broad topic.
"The brain uses electricity" and "Lightning is electricity" warrant "associated"
at most — not "supports" or "causes". Topical proximity without a conceptual
mechanism = "associated".

If not meaningfully related:
{{"related": false}}

Respond ONLY with JSON. No preamble.
"""

CLUSTER_PROMPT = """
Given this conceptual statement, assign it to a single domain cluster.

Use a SHORT, SPECIFIC lowercase label — prefer sub-domain labels over broad ones.

Prefer SPECIFIC over BROAD:
  thermodynamics     (not physics)
  evolutionary_biology (not biology)
  deep_learning      (not computer_science, if the statement is specifically about NNs)
  game_theory        (not economics, if the statement is specifically about strategic interaction)
  molecular_biology  (not biology, if the statement is about DNA/proteins/cells)
  quantum_mechanics  (not physics, if the statement is about quantum phenomena)
  statistical_mechanics (not physics or thermodynamics, if about microstates/ensembles)

General domain labels to use when no specific sub-domain fits:
  neuroscience, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, computer_science,
  psychology, philosophy_of_science, linguistics, economics, sociology,
  cognitive_science, information_theory, systems_biology, ecology,
  genetics, general

Rules:
- If the statement spans two domains, choose the MOST SPECIFIC one.
- Prefer the domain the statement is ABOUT over the domain it USES.
  Example: "Neural networks learn via gradient descent" → deep_learning
  Example: "The brain's learning rule resembles backpropagation" → neuroscience
  Example: "Entropy in thermodynamic systems equals k*ln(W)" → thermodynamics
  Example: "Shannon entropy measures uncertainty in distributions" → information_theory

CONTRADICTION_CHECK_PROMPT = """
Existing node: {existing}
New node: {new}

Do these two ideas make MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE claims?

The test for a genuine contradiction:
  If the existing node is TRUE, does the new node become IMPOSSIBLE or FALSE?
  If the new node is TRUE, does the existing node become IMPOSSIBLE or FALSE?

Both must be true for this to be a contradiction.

Examples of GENUINE contradictions (answer: yes):
  "All objects fall at the same rate in a vacuum"
  vs "Heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones" → YES (mutually exclusive)

  "Acquired traits can be inherited by offspring"
  vs "Only genetic mutations are heritable, not acquired traits" → YES

Examples of NOT contradictions (answer: no):
  "Neural networks need large datasets to generalize"
  vs "Regularization helps neural networks generalize with less data" → NO (compatible)

  "Natural selection favors reproductive fitness"
  vs "Genetic drift changes allele frequencies randomly" → NO (different mechanisms, not exclusive)

  "Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes training noise"
  vs "Regularization techniques reduce overfitting by penalizing complexity" → NO
  (problem + solution: both can be true simultaneously)

  "Game theory assumes perfectly rational agents"
  vs "Behavioral economics shows humans deviate from rational predictions" → NO
  (theory + empirical critique: the critique does not make the theory impossible,
  it adds boundary conditions. Both statements can be simultaneously true.)

  "X has property P"
  vs "Technique Y mitigates or reduces P" → NO, always. Mitigation is not negation.

Respond with ONLY "yes" or "no". No explanation.

Answer NO if:
  - They make different claims (even if about the same topic)
  - One adds a genuinely new sub-idea the other doesn't contain
