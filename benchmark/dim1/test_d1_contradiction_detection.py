"""
Dimension 1 — Test 5: Contradiction Detection Accuracy
=======================================================
Injects 10 genuinely contradicting statement pairs and 10 compatible
statement pairs into the ingestor. Measures whether the system correctly
fires the contradiction check and creates CONTRADICTS edges for the
contradicting pairs, and does NOT create them for the compatible pairs.

Metrics:
  - True positive rate  (contradictions caught)
  - True negative rate  (compatible pairs not wrongly flagged)
  - Precision / Recall / F1

Pass criterion:
  - Precision >= 0.80 (not too many false alarms)
  - Recall    >= 0.70 (catches most real contradictions)

Usage:
    python test_d1_contradiction_detection.py \
        --judge-model <ollama-model-name> \
        --out results/d1_contradiction_detection.json
