Dimension 1 — Test 3: Edge Accuracy

NOTE on 'associated' edge type:
  'associated' edges are NOT produced by the LLM extraction pipeline.
  They are added automatically by _add_weak_edges() via FAISS similarity.
  Testing LLM extraction for 'associated' is testing the wrong code path.
  The three 'associated' ground-truth pairs below test whether the LLM
  correctly returns related=false (no explicit relationship), which is
  the correct system behavior for weakly-related pairs.
  The test maps related=false → 'unrelated', and checks it does NOT
  assign a strong type. This replaces the old 'associated' type check.
======================================
Uses a hand-curated set of 20 concept pairs with KNOWN ground-truth
relationship types. Runs each pair through the ingestor's edge extraction
pipeline, then compares extracted edge type to ground truth.

Metrics:
  - Overall accuracy (correct type / total pairs)
  - Per-type precision and recall
  - Confusion matrix
  - LLM judge validation of edge narrations

Pass criterion:
  - Overall edge type accuracy >= 70%  (unchanged)
  - No SEMANTIC edge type (supports/causes/contradicts/analogy) has recall < 50%
  - "unrelated" blind spot is acceptable (system should never output this label)

Usage:
    python test_d1_edge_accuracy.py \
        --judge-model <ollama-model-name> \
        --out results/d1_edge_accuracy.json
